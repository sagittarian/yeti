Yeti is a simple Wordpress plugin to add a Youtube search to the editor.

== Description ==

Yeti adds a Youtube search button to the post editor (in the second column
of buttons under "Show Kitchen Sink").
When you press the button, a dialog box will be opened that will
allow you to search Youtube, view the results in the dialog box, and embed
a result in the post you are editing.
